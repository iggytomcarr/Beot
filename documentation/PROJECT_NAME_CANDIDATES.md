# Project Codename Candidates

A focus/pomodoro timer with visual growth themes (forest, star systems) and accountability tracking.

---

## Top Candidates

### Beot ⭐
**Origin:** Anglo-Saxon
**Pronunciation:** BAY-oht (two syllables)
**Meaning:** A formal boast or vow made publicly

A beot wasn't empty bragging - it was a **binding promise** of what you would accomplish. In Anglo-Saxon warrior culture, men would stand in the mead hall before their lord and companions and declare what they intended to do. Your honour was now on the line. Breaking a beot brought deep shame.

The ritual appears throughout Old English literature, most famously in Beowulf. Before facing Grendel, warriors would rise and make their beots - vows of what they would accomplish or die trying. The beot was witnessed, remembered, and you would be held to it.

The structure:
1. **Declare** your intention publicly
2. **Commit** - your honour is now staked
3. **Accomplish** or face shame

Related concepts: "gylp" (boast) and "gilpcwide" (boast-speech). The beot was specifically the vow component - the promise that bound you.

**Why it fits:** 
- Starting a session = making your beot, a vow to focus
- The accountability angle is built into the word's meaning
- Complete the session or it's logged as abandoned (shame/💀)
- All or nothing - you can't half-keep a beot
- Short, punchy, great for CLI: `beot start`, `beot stats`
- Uncommon in tech, memorable, meaningful
- The mead hall / communal aspect could extend to the shared web visualisations later

### Ogma
**Origin:** Irish Celtic
**Domain:** Eloquence, learning, writing, language

A god of the Tuatha Dé Danann (the tribe of the goddess Danu). Ogma is credited with inventing the Ogham alphabet - an ancient Irish writing system where characters are carved as notches along the edge of standing stones or wooden staves. The alphabet itself is named after him.

He's depicted as a champion and poet - unusual combination of physical strength and intellectual power. In some tales he's called "Ogma Gríanainech" (sun-faced) and "Ogma Cermait" (honey-mouthed) for his eloquence.

His Gaulish equivalent, Ogmios, was depicted as an old man leading willing followers by thin gold chains attached from his tongue to their ears - a beautiful metaphor for the power of persuasive speech and teaching.

**Why it fits:** Direct connection to learning, writing, and knowledge. Short, memorable, easy to type as a CLI command. The Ogham connection to carved marks on wood/stone pairs nicely with tracking progress visually.

---

### Awen
**Origin:** Welsh Celtic
**Domain:** Poetic inspiration, creative flowing spirit

Not a god but a concept - the divine inspiration that flows through poets, bards, and craftspeople. The word literally means "flowing spirit" or "essence." It represents that state of creative flow where work comes naturally.

In Welsh bardic tradition, Awen was invoked before performances. The symbol of Awen is three rays of light emanating from three points - representing the balance of opposites and divine inspiration flowing down.

The legendary bard Taliesin was said to have received Awen after accidentally tasting three drops from the goddess Ceridwen's cauldron of inspiration. Those three drops contained all the world's wisdom.

**Why it fits:** Captures the flow state you're trying to cultivate. Beautiful word. The "three drops" legend could map nicely to the pomodoro concept - small concentrated doses of focus that add up to wisdom.

### Nemeton
**Origin:** Pan-Celtic (Gaulish)
**Domain:** Sacred groves, places of worship and focus

A nemeton was a sacred grove or clearing in the forest where Celtic peoples gathered for rituals, judgments, and communion with the divine. The word appears across Celtic cultures - in Galatian, Gaulish, and British place names.

These weren't temples with walls - they were natural spaces set apart from the ordinary world. Boundaries were marked, and the space within was considered charged with spiritual significance. Roman writers described druids gathering in forest groves for their most important rites.

Famous nemetons include Drunemeton ("oak sanctuary") in Galatia and Medionemeton in Scotland. The word survives in place names like Nanterre (Nemetodurum) near Paris.

**Why it fits:** Literally "sacred grove" - perfect for the forest visualisation theme. Also represents a boundaried space for focused activity, which is exactly what a pomodoro session creates. The concept of setting apart time/space for meaningful work.

---

### Wyrd
**Origin:** Anglo-Saxon
**Domain:** Fate, destiny, the web of choices

Wyrd is the Anglo-Saxon concept of fate - but not fate as predetermined destiny. It's more like the web of cause and effect that you weave through your choices. Every action adds threads to your wyrd.

The word is the ancestor of modern "weird" (which originally meant "having power over fate"). The Wyrd Sisters in Macbeth are the Fate Sisters.

In Saxon thought, your wyrd was constantly being woven by your actions. The past was fixed, but the future was being created by present choices. There was also "orlaeg" - the layers of fate already laid down by past actions that shape your present circumstances.

The concept relates to Urðr (Urd), one of the three Norns in Norse mythology who tend the Well of Fate at the base of Yggdrasil, the world tree.

**Why it fits:** The accountability angle - complete sessions or abandon them, each choice weaves your fate. The "web" metaphor could work visually. Also connects to trees via Yggdrasil. The idea that you're actively building your destiny through small daily choices.

---

### Lugh
**Origin:** Irish Celtic
**Domain:** Craftsmanship, skills, mastery of all arts

Lugh Lámhfhada ("Lugh of the Long Arm") is one of the most important Celtic gods. His epithet "Samildánach" means "equally skilled in all arts" - he mastered every craft and discipline.

The legend: When Lugh arrived at the hall of the Tuatha Dé Danann at Tara, the doorkeeper asked his skill. Lugh said he was a carpenter - but they had one. A smith - they had one. A champion, harper, poet, historian, sorcerer, physician, cupbearer, brazier - they had all of these. Lugh asked: "Do you have anyone who can do ALL of these?" He was admitted.

Lugh led the Tuatha Dé Danann to victory against the Fomorians at the Second Battle of Mag Tuired. He's associated with the harvest festival Lughnasadh (1st August).

His name may derive from a root meaning "light" or "oath." Cognates appear across Celtic regions - Welsh Lleu, Gaulish Lugus.

**Why it fits:** You're learning multiple subjects (Go, Godot, React, Music). The "many-skilled" god for someone building diverse abilities. Also suggests mastery through dedicated practice.

## Other Strong Options

### Brigid
**Origin:** Irish Celtic
**Domain:** Crafts, poetry, smithing, healing, fire, inspiration

One of the most beloved Celtic deities, Brigid (also Brighid, Bríg) was so important that she was transformed into a Christian saint rather than forgotten. Her festival Imbolc (1st February) became St Brigid's Day.

She's a goddess of fire in multiple forms - the fire of the forge (craft and making), the fire of the hearth (home and sustenance), and the fire of inspiration (poetry and creativity). Sacred flames were kept burning in her honour at Kildare.

Brigid is often depicted as a triple goddess - three sisters all named Brigid, each governing different domains. This ties to the Celtic love of threes.

**Why it fits:** The fire/ember connection to streaks. Goddess of both crafts (coding) and inspiration (music, creativity). The eternal flame metaphor for consistent practice.

---

### Woden
**Origin:** Anglo-Saxon (Norse: Odin)
**Domain:** Wisdom, knowledge, poetry, the dead, runes, sacrifice

The chief of the Saxon gods, giving his name to Wednesday (Woden's Day). He's the relentless seeker of knowledge, willing to pay any price for wisdom.

Key myths: He sacrificed his eye at Mímir's well to gain wisdom. He hung himself on Yggdrasil (the world tree) for nine days and nights, wounded by his own spear, to gain knowledge of the runes. He has two ravens, Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory), who fly across the world gathering information.

Woden is associated with ecstatic states, poetry, and the "fury" of creative inspiration. The word "wood" meaning mad/frenzied comes from his name.

**Why it fits:** The sacrificed eye = focused attention (you sacrifice distractions). The hanging on the tree = enduring discomfort for knowledge. Ravens gathering information = learning. Strong tree imagery.

---

### Tiw / Tyr
**Origin:** Anglo-Saxon (Norse: Týr)
**Domain:** Justice, oaths, law, self-sacrifice, martial honour

Tuesday's namesake. Tiw was a god of war but specifically of the *rules* of war - honour, oaths kept, fair combat. He's associated with the thing (assembly) where disputes were settled.

The defining myth: The gods needed to bind the monstrous wolf Fenrir but the wolf would only allow the chain if a god put their hand in his mouth as pledge. Tiw volunteered, knowing the binding would hold and he would lose his hand. He sacrificed it willingly for the greater good.

Tiw is often depicted as one-handed after this sacrifice. His rune (ᛏ) looks like an arrow pointing upward.

**Why it fits:** The oath-keeping aspect - you commit to a session. The self-sacrifice angle - giving up comfort/distraction for growth. The "all or nothing" approach to sessions mirrors Tiw putting his hand in.

---

### Cernunnos
**Origin:** Gaulish Celtic  
**Domain:** Nature, forests, animals, growth, fertility, the cycle of life

The "Horned One" - depicted with antlers like a stag, often seated cross-legged, surrounded by animals, sometimes holding a torc (ring of power) and a ram-headed serpent.

Most famously shown on the Gundestrup Cauldron. His name comes from a single partial inscription found in Paris - we actually know very little about his worship, but the horned god figure appears across Celtic art.

He represents the wild, the forests, and the cycle of growth - antlers shed and regrow annually, symbolising death and rebirth, the seasons, the cycle of effort and rest.

**Why it fits:** Direct forest connection. The cycle of growth - sessions building up like antlers over time. The wild creative energy of nature. Sitting in focused meditation posture.

---

### Danu
**Origin:** Irish Celtic
**Domain:** Primordial wisdom, mother of the gods, earth, rivers

The mother goddess of the Tuatha Dé Danann ("peoples of the goddess Danu"). She's ancient and somewhat mysterious - we have her name embedded in her people's name but few direct myths about her.

She may be connected to the Danube river (both names from Proto-Indo-European *danu meaning "river" or "to flow"). Water, flow, the source from which knowledge springs.

As the mother of the Irish gods including Ogma, Brigid, and others, she represents the primordial source of wisdom and power.

**Why it fits:** The "source" of knowledge and growth. Flow state connection. The mother of other gods including Ogma and Brigid - could be the overarching project name with features named after her children.

## Considerations

**For CLI usage:** Shorter is better. `beot start`, `ogma start`, `lugh stats`, `awen timer` all feel good.

**For the web layer later:** Nemeton, Wyrd, and Cernunnos have strong visual potential.

**For the accountability angle:** Beot (binding vow) is the strongest fit. Wyrd (weaving your fate) and Tiw (keeping oaths) also resonate.

**For the learning angle:** Ogma (inventor of writing) and Lugh (many-skilled) fit perfectly.

**For the forest theme:** Nemeton (sacred grove) and Cernunnos (horned forest god) are direct hits.

## Notes

Feel free to combine - the project could be called one thing with features/themes named after others. For example:
- **Nemeton** as the app, with **Ogham** as the visual system (marks/notches for sessions)
- **Wyrd** as the app, with sessions "weaving" your fate
- **Awen** as the app, with the three-ray symbol as the logo
